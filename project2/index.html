				<h2>American Football</h2>
				<p><strong>American football</strong> (referred to as <em>football</em> in the United States and Canada, 
				also known as gridiron elsewhere) is a sport played by two teams of eleven 
				players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, 
				the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance 
				down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without 
				control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control 
				of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in 
				four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; 
				if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily 
				scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown 
				or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The 
				team with the most points at the end of a game wins.</p>
			
				<p>American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sport
				of rugby football. The first game of American football was played on November 6, 1869,
				between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, under rules resembling
				a mix of rugby and soccer. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880
				onward by Walter Camp, the "Father of American Football," established the snap,
				eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs; later rule changes legalized
				the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size 
				and shape of the football.</p>
			
				<p>American football as a whole is the most popular sport in the United States;
				professional football and college football are the most popular forms of
				the game, with the other major levels being high school and youth football. 
				As of 2012, nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes 
				play the sport in the United States annually. The <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr>, 
				the most popular American football league, has the highest average attendance 
				of any sports league in the world; its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks 
				among the most-watched club sporting events in the world, and the league has 
				an annual revenue of around US$10 billion.</p>

				<h2 id="teams">Teams and Positions</h2>
				<p>A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each. Playing 
				with more on the field is punishable by a penalty. Teams may substitute 
				any number of their players between downs;this "platoon" system 
				replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and 
				has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special 
				teams squads.
			
				<h3>Offensive Unit</h3>
				<p>The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field 
				with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown. The offensive team must line 
				up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball. An offensive formation 
				is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or 
				fewer than five players numbered 50-79 on the offensive line.Players can temporarily 
				line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits 
				as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs 
				the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, with the exception 
				of the snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the 
				ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the 
				snap of the ball.</p>
				<p>The main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB)
				and fullback (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either he 
				or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the 
				offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback 
				lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, 
				throws it or runs with it. The primary role of the halfback, also known as 
				the tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve 
				as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily 
				as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations 
				and often are not used in passing situations.</p>
				<p>The offensive line (OL) consists of several players whose primary function 
				is to block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on 
				running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of the 
				offensive line is the center (C), who is responsible for snapping the ball to 
				the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their 
				jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while 
				tackles (T) line up outside of the guards.</p>
				<p>The principal receivers are the wide receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). 
				Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside of the line. 
				The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, 
				but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. 
				Tight ends line up outside of the tackles and function both as receivers and 
				as blockers.</p>
				<h3>Defensive Unit</h3>
				<p>The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling 
				the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles).The defensive 
				line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive 
				ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, 
				between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and 
				defensive tackles is to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, 
				to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the 
				linebackers can break through.Linebackers line up behind the defensive 
				line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two 
				types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers 
				are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles 
				include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide 
				receivers and tight ends in the passing game.</p>
				<p>he defensive backfield, often called the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB)
				and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) 
				and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, 
				typically opposite of a receiver so as to be able to cover him, while safeties 
				line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties 
				are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing 
				plays as well as running plays.</p>
				<h2>Special Teams</h2>
				<p>The special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays. The special 
				teams unit of the team in control of the ball will try and execute field goal 
				(FG) attempts, punts and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to 
				block or return them. Three positions are specific to the field goal and PAT 
				(point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long 
				snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, 
				who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a 
				holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder 
				may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from 
				remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the 
				ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR). The positions specific to punt 
				plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps 
				the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it 
				hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside of the line and race down the 
				field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR) - the player that catches 
				the punt.</p>
